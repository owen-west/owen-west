# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

I am a dedicated double major student at Wilfrid Laurier University, majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. My passion is centered around computer graphics, and I invest a significant portion of my energy into exploring this field.

## About Me

- ðŸŽ“ Double Major: Computer Science & Mathematics at Wilfrid Laurier University
- ðŸŽ¨ Enthusiastic about Computer Graphics

## Featured Projects

Here is my most notable project that reflects my interests and skills:

- ([PPM_Raytracer](https://github.com/owen-west/PPMRaytracer)):
   - Sophisticated raytracer built from scratch in C++ to create realistic 3D renderings, including
shading, lighting, and shadows, with a focus on rendering spheres of varying materials and colours
   - Implemented rendering techniques, such as ray-sphere intersection algorithms, and reflection/refraction,
to achieve lifelike visual effects, enhancing understanding of computer graphics principles
   - Utilized object-oriented design principles to create a modular and extensible codebase, enabling easy
addition of new features and rendering objects beyond spheres
   - Independently optimized the raytracerâ€™s rendering performance, achieving efficient rendering times while
maintaining high-quality output, demonstrating strong problem-solving and self-motivation skills

## Technical Skills

- **Programming Languages:** C, C++, HLSL, Python, C#
- **Tools:** Visual Studio, PIX, Git, GitHub
- **Technologies:** Direct3D 11/12, DXR (DirectX Raytracing)
