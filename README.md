# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

I'm a passionate double major student in Computer Science and Mathematics at Wilfrid Laurier University, with a keen interest in low-level programming using C++, with most of my energy going into computer graphics. I am interested in pursuing similar fields such as compilers, embedded, computer vision, and driver development.

## About Me

- 🎓 Double Major: Computer Science & Mathematics at Wilfrid Laurier University
- 👨‍💻 Aspiring Low-Level Programmer
- 🎨 Enthusiastic about Computer Graphics

## Featured Projects

Here is my most notable GitHub project that reflects my interests and skills:

- ([PPM_Raytracer](https://github.com/owen-west/PPMRaytracer)):
   - Sophisticated raytracer built from scratch in C++ to create realistic 3D renderings, including
shading, lighting, and shadows, with a focus on rendering spheres of varying materials and colours
   - Implemented rendering techniques, such as ray-sphere intersection algorithms, and reflection/refraction,
to achieve lifelike visual effects, enhancing understanding of computer graphics principles
   - Utilized object-oriented design principles to create a modular and extensible codebase, enabling easy
addition of new features and rendering objects beyond spheres
   - Independently optimized the raytracer’s rendering performance, achieving efficient rendering times while
maintaining high-quality output, demonstrating strong problem-solving and self-motivation skills
