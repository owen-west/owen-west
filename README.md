# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

I am a student at Wilfrid Laurier University, double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. My passion is centered around computer graphics, and I invest a significant portion of my energy into exploring this field.

## Featured Projects

Here is my most notable project that reflects my interests and skills:

- ([PPM_Raytracer](https://github.com/owen-west/PPMRaytracer)):
   - Sophisticated raytracer built from scratch in C++ to create realistic 3D renderings, including
shading, lighting, and shadows, with a focus on rendering spheres of varying materials and colours
   - Implemented rendering techniques, such as ray-sphere intersection algorithms, and reflection/refraction,
to achieve lifelike visual effects, enhancing understanding of computer graphics principles
   - Utilized object-oriented design principles to create a modular and extensible codebase, enabling easy
addition of new features and rendering objects beyond spheres
   - Independently optimized the raytracerâ€™s rendering performance, achieving efficient rendering times while
maintaining high-quality output, demonstrating strong problem-solving and self-motivation skills
